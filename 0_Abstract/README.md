# Wiper System

## Objective

 Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe raindrops or any water from the vehicle’s windscreen. The previous system
used to activate the wiper manually and the process of pulling up the wiper is difficult to be handled. Thus, this system is
proposed to solve these problems. The objectives of this project are to upgrade the older cars system by providing automatic
wiping system, to improve the system by using sensor with actuator and to design a basic program that will fully operate with
the system. The concept of this proposed wiper system is similar with other existing conventional wiper. In spite of removing
water from windscreen, this system also will be upgraded to an automatic control system by using a STM32
controller and water sensor. As the conclusion for the project, the results shows all the aim
objectives are successfully achieved. The wiper system was well functionally according the water condition from the outside of a
car. 

 

## Implementation


 This project showed a contribution on the design of the automatic wiper system for the future research in this same field. It
is recommended that the system to have a study on the wiper material that been used to make a wiper because the driver at hot
and climate country are facing the problems regards to the wiper material.n. Wipers are designed
and made to clear the water from a windscreen. Most of cars have two wipers on the windscreen, one on the rear
window and the other on each headlight. The wiper parts visible from outside the car are the rubber blade, the wiper
arm holding the blade, a spring linkage, and parts of the wiper pivots. The wiper itself has about six parts called pressure points or claws that are small arms under the wiper



## Description

 The main purpose of the wiper system is to clean the windscreen sufficiently to provide suitable visibility at all times. The wiper system must perform the following tasks.
* Efficient removal of dirt, water and snow.
* Operation in the temperature range of 243 K to 353 K.
* The ability to pass the stall and snow load test.
* A service life of around 1500 000 wipe cycles.
* Resistance to corrosion from acid, alkalis and ozone.
