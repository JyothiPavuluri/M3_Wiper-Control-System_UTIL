##  Introduction:

Scenario: Wiper Control System.
Ignition Key Position at ACC: The Red LED is ON, if the user button is pressed and held for 2 secs
Wiper ON: Wiper is OFF: On press of the user input, Blue, Green and Orange LEDs come ON one at a time with the set frequency, The frequency changes on every alternate key press, 3 frequency levels with 1, 4 and 8 Hz
Wiper OFF: Wiper is ON: The LED glow pattern stops on the 4th press; the wiper action starts next press onwards as mentioned in step 2
Ignition Key Position at Lock: The Red LED is OFF, if the user button is pressed and held for 2 secs

## Benefits of Wiper Control System

Automatic Wipers can be understood as smart wipers that automatically turn on sensing rain, and adjust their speed as per the intensity of rainfall. Most automatic wipers use a sensor that is placed behind the windshield. When it rains, the sensor beams out infrared light that is reflected back at different angles based upon the intensity of water droplets falling on the windshield. The more the rain, the less the light is reflected. Based on the amount of light reflected, the system activates the wiper and controls its speed as well.

## Basic Requirements
* Hardware Equipment
* Software

## Used components

The Following are the important components to build Wiper Control System
* ARM Based Microcontrollers
* 4 LEDs
* 1 Switch
* 1 Timer

## Features:
 * Wiper Control System controls up to 9 windshield wipers. 
 * Each wiper has its own on/off  button.
 * Blue,Green,Orange LEDs,Come ON and OFF alternately for set frequency State A, RED led will be ON and after wipers are grouped together for simultaneous on/off control.
 * buttons are available for Low/High Speed, Heating and Washing functions. 
 * In Low speed mode the interval can be varied with the Interval+/Interval- pushbuttons.
 * The wipers are synchronized with each other.
 *  The washing function includes spraying, wiping and purging. 


# SWOT Analysis- Strengths, and Weakness, Opportunities threats

## Strengths

* It is possible to operate manually/automatically by providing ON/OFF switch.
* Easy usage of features with a user press button
* You can make your own.
* Cost Effective

## Weakness

* This system applied in the case of water falling on the class only.
* Alert will be start when rain is there,sometimes it disturbs human.
* Limited usage range

## Opportunities

* It improved visibility of car windshield during rain.
* This mechanism can be applied to heavy automation like buses,trucks etc., with little modification.
* It can be implemented at house window for cleaning.

## Threats

* It is totally dependent on timer circuit.
* A slight modification in it leads to a bettrt cleaning system.
